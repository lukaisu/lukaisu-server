Answer: Your local webserver (Apache) is not running.
Please start it via EasyPHP or MAMP control program/panel.

Answer: The server is running, but the application is not found.
Maybe the Uniform Resource Identifier (URI) is wrong or misspelled.
Please check/correct it. Or the URI is correct, and the application is installed,
but not in the correct directory _lukaisu_ below _htdocs_.
Please install/copy/move it into the correct directory.  

## Database connection error

parameters in your _.env_ file are wrong.
Please check/correct the database connection parameters and/or start MySQL via the MAMP or EasyPHP control program/panel.

Answer: The Webserver and the database is running, but the database connection parameter file _.env_ is not found.
Please copy `.env.example` to `.env` and configure your database credentials.

## Do not run on Linux after installation/update

If Lukaisu Server installed or updated Lukaisu Server on Linux, but the application does not run as expected.

Answer 1: The Webserver does not have full access to all Lukaisu Server files (insufficient rights).
Open a terminal window, go to the directory where the directory "lukaisu-server" has been created with all Lukaisu Server files, e. g.  
**cd /var/www/html**  
Now execute:
**sudo chmod -R 755 lukaisu-server**.  

Answer 2: The PHP "mbstring" extension is not installed.
Please install it: [see this article](https://askubuntu.com/questions/491629/how-to-install-php-mbstring-extension-in-ubuntu).

## MeCab not detected

Lukaisu Server cannot find MeCab, you can do the following steps:

On Linux or Mac:

1. Open a terminal.
2. Type `mecab -v` to get the current MeCab version. If nothing is displayed MeCab is not installed.
3. If MeCab is already installed, the path may be missing. If you are using MAMP type  

```bash
printf 'export PATH="/usr/local/sbin:/usr/local/bin:/usr/bin:/bin:/usr/sbin:/sbin"' >> /Applications/MAMP/Library/bin/envvars
```
