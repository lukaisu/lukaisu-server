# Optional Post-Installation Steps

Lukaisu Server is a all-in-one product, but you can extend its capabilities in various ways.
Here are the additional features unavailable by default.

## Parse Japanese with MeCab

[MeCab](https://taku910.github.io/mecab/) is a Japanese parser. Installing it has
two main advantages:

* Much better parsing of Japanese texts than RegExp.
* Automatic romanization of words.
* Enables text-to-speech for any character group.

### Installation

### Standard Installtion

1. Follow the instructions to download MeCab at <https://taku910.github.io/mecab/#install>.
2. Add MeCab to your system PATH.
3. In Lukaisu Server, go to "Edit Languages" → "Japanese" and change from the value for "RegExp Word Characters" to ``mecab``.

### Using Docker

Original instructions provided on [Easily Set Up and Use MeCab With Docker and NodeJS (Medium)](https://nickramkissoon.medium.com/easily-set-up-and-use-mecab-with-docker-and-nodejs-5f01ae761a61).

1. Run your Lukaisu Server container in interactive mode and install MeCab.

    ```bash
    docker exec -it lukaisu-server bash
    apt-get update && apt-get install -y mecab libmecab-dev mecab-ipadic-utf8
    ```

2. In Lukaisu Server, go to "Edit Languages" → "Japanese" and change from the value for "RegExp Word Characters" to ``mecab``.

## Automatic Translation

### LibreTranslate

[LibreTranslate](https://libretranslate.com/) is a great open-source tool that allows you to translate text and provides an API.
With it you can achieve the following:

* Translation of sentences without using Google Translate.
* Automatic translation of words (so you don't need to fill by hand!).

![LibreTranslate Demo](/assets/images/libretranslate_demo.png)

To use it, please read the following steps:

1. [Install it](https://github.com/LibreTranslate/LibreTranslate#install-and-run) on a local or remote server or using Docker.
2. In Lukaisu Server, go to "Edit Langagues", either create a new or edit an existing language
3. In the field "Sentence Translator URI", replace it by the URL of you libre translate instance.
   * Do not forget to add the parameter ``lukaisu_translator=libretranslate`` for the automatic translation!
   * ``source=`` should be followed by two letters indicating the language translating from.
   * ``target=`` should be followed by two letters indicating the language to translate to.

## Enhanced Text-to-Speech

The Text-to-Speech may sound robotic with some languages or operating systems. A
workaround is to download a Text-To-Speech (TTS) plugin such as [Read Aloud](https://readaloud.app/).

## Multi-User Mode

Lukaisu Server supports a multi-user mode where each user has their own isolated data. This is useful for:

* Sharing a single Lukaisu Server instance among multiple learners
* Securing data access in a shared environment
* Enabling user registration and authentication

### Enabling Multi-User Mode

1. Edit your `.env` file and add:

   ```dotenv
   MULTI_USER_ENABLED=true
   ```

2. Restart your web server.

3. The first time you access Lukaisu Server, you'll be prompted to create an admin account.

### Password Requirements

When creating accounts in multi-user mode, passwords must meet the following requirements:

| Requirement | Description |
|-------------|-------------|
| **Minimum Length** | 8 characters |
| **Maximum Length** | 128 characters |
| **Letters** | At least one letter (a-z or A-Z) |
| **Numbers** | At least one number (0-9) |

::: tip Security Best Practices
For production deployments, we recommend:

* Use a strong, unique password (12+ characters with mixed case, numbers, and symbols)
* Never reuse passwords from other services
* Consider using a password manager
* Always use HTTPS in production
:::

### Password Hashing

Lukaisu Server uses modern password hashing algorithms:

* **Argon2ID** (preferred) - Memory-hard algorithm resistant to GPU attacks
* **bcrypt** (fallback) - Used if Argon2ID is unavailable

Passwords are never stored in plain text and cannot be recovered—only reset.

### Switching an Existing Install From Single-User to Multi-User {#switching-to-multi-user}

If you flip `MULTI_USER_ENABLED=true` on an install that already has data,
the first account you register is auto-promoted to admin (when no admin
account exists yet) and any data rows still left without an owner are
automatically claimed for them. In most cases there is nothing else to do.

#### The "ghost admin" leftover row

The migration that introduced multi-user support
(`20251212_000001_add_users_table.sql`) ships an `INSERT IGNORE` that
seeds a placeholder admin row (`UsUsername='admin'`, `UsEmail='admin@localhost'`,
no password hash). This row was a workaround for the data-ownership backfill
in the very next migration; it cannot log in (`Login` rejects null password
hashes) and the first-admin promotion logic ignores it. **Most operators
will never need to touch it.**

There is one edge case where it becomes user-visible: if your install
ran the migration backfill *while the ghost row existed* (i.e. you had
existing data, ran the migrations, and the backfill assigned that data
to the ghost), then after enabling multi-user mode the data is owned by
an account no one can log in as. A real registrant will still be auto-
promoted to admin (`countAdmins()` filters on `UsPasswordHash IS NOT NULL`,
so the ghost doesn't count) but their `ClaimOrphanRows` step only
reassigns *NULL-owner* rows — ghost-owned rows stay attached to the
ghost and remain invisible.

#### Detecting whether you are affected

After enabling multi-user mode and registering your first real account,
run this query against your database:

```sql
SELECT
    (SELECT COUNT(*) FROM languages
        JOIN users ON languages.LgUsID = users.UsID
        WHERE users.UsRole = 'admin' AND users.UsPasswordHash IS NULL) AS ghost_languages,
    (SELECT COUNT(*) FROM texts
        JOIN users ON texts.TxUsID = users.UsID
        WHERE users.UsRole = 'admin' AND users.UsPasswordHash IS NULL) AS ghost_texts,
    (SELECT COUNT(*) FROM words
        JOIN users ON words.WoUsID = users.UsID
        WHERE users.UsRole = 'admin' AND users.UsPasswordHash IS NULL) AS ghost_words;
```

If any column is non-zero, your install has ghost-owned data.

#### Manual cleanup

::: danger Back up first
The user FKs are `ON DELETE CASCADE`. Deleting the ghost row before
reassigning its data will cascade-delete every language, text, word,
tag, feed, book, and local dictionary that points at it. **Always run
the UPDATEs first, verify the counts, then DELETE.**
:::

Substitute `<your_admin_id>` with the `UsID` of the real admin you want
to own this data (from `SELECT UsID, UsUsername FROM users
WHERE UsPasswordHash IS NOT NULL AND UsRole='admin';`):

```sql
-- 1. Capture the ghost's UsID for reuse below.
SET @ghost_id = (
    SELECT UsID FROM users
    WHERE UsRole = 'admin'
      AND UsPasswordHash IS NULL
      AND UsApiToken IS NULL
      AND UsLastLogin IS NULL
    LIMIT 1
);

-- 2. Reassign every data table the ghost can own.
UPDATE languages          SET LgUsID = <your_admin_id> WHERE LgUsID = @ghost_id;
UPDATE texts              SET TxUsID = <your_admin_id> WHERE TxUsID = @ghost_id;
UPDATE words              SET WoUsID = <your_admin_id> WHERE WoUsID = @ghost_id;
UPDATE tags               SET TgUsID = <your_admin_id> WHERE TgUsID = @ghost_id;
UPDATE text_tags          SET T2UsID = <your_admin_id> WHERE T2UsID = @ghost_id;
UPDATE news_feeds         SET NfUsID = <your_admin_id> WHERE NfUsID = @ghost_id;
UPDATE books              SET BkUsID = <your_admin_id> WHERE BkUsID = @ghost_id;
UPDATE local_dictionaries SET LdUsID = <your_admin_id> WHERE LdUsID = @ghost_id;

-- 3. Now safe to delete the ghost (no FK references remain).
DELETE FROM users WHERE UsID = @ghost_id;
```

After step 3, log out and back in. Your admin account now sees the
previously-hidden data. If you have multiple ghost rows (you shouldn't,
but legacy installs may), repeat for each.

::: tip Why not automate this?
Every alternative we considered — auto-cleanup at first registration,
a follow-up migration, editing the original migration — either
created cross-install drift, ran inside the test bootstrap and broke
unrelated assertions, or both. The recipe above is the one path that
is reliably idempotent across every install and lets you verify the
counts before pulling the trigger.
:::

## Behind a Reverse Proxy (TLS Offloading) {#reverse-proxy}

If you run Lukaisu Server behind a reverse proxy that terminates TLS for you
(Traefik, Caddy, nginx, HAProxy, Apache `mod_proxy`, Cloudflare
Tunnel, …), the connection from the proxy to the Lukaisu Server container is
plain HTTP. PHP only sees the inner hop, so without configuration
Lukaisu Server thinks the request was HTTP and generates `http://` URLs in
emails, OAuth callbacks, and the admin "Server Location" panel.
The page loads fine over HTTPS, but anything that builds an absolute
URL is wrong.

### Quick fix

Set both of these in your `.env` and restart the container:

```dotenv
APP_URL=https://your-domain.example
TRUST_PROXY=true
```

* **`APP_URL`** — the public origin (scheme + host) of your Lukaisu Server
  install. When set, Lukaisu Server uses it verbatim for every absolute URL it
  generates, ignoring whatever the request looked like. This is the
  most reliable knob; set it whenever you have a stable public URL.
* **`TRUST_PROXY`** — whether Lukaisu Server should honour `X-Forwarded-Proto`,
  `X-Forwarded-Host`, and `X-Forwarded-Ssl` from the proxy. **Default
  is `true`**, so most installs Just Work without setting it. Set it
  to `false` only if Lukaisu Server is reachable directly on the public internet
  without a proxy in front (see security note below).

### Sample reverse-proxy config

::: code-group
```yaml [Traefik labels]
labels:
  - "traefik.http.routers.lukaisu-server.rule=Host(`your-domain.example`)"
  - "traefik.http.routers.lukaisu-server.entrypoints=websecure"
  - "traefik.http.routers.lukaisu-server.tls=true"
  - "traefik.http.services.lukaisu-server.loadbalancer.server.port=80"
```

```caddy [Caddyfile]
your-domain.example {
    reverse_proxy lukaisu:80
}
```

```nginx [nginx]
server {
    listen 443 ssl http2;
    server_name your-domain.example;

    ssl_certificate     /path/to/fullchain.pem;
    ssl_certificate_key /path/to/privkey.pem;

    location / {
        proxy_pass http://lukaisu:80;
        proxy_set_header Host              $host;
        proxy_set_header X-Forwarded-Proto $scheme;
        proxy_set_header X-Forwarded-Host  $host;
        proxy_set_header X-Forwarded-For   $proxy_add_x_forwarded_for;
    }
}
```
:::

Caddy and Traefik set the `X-Forwarded-*` headers automatically; with
nginx you set them explicitly as shown.

### Security note: when to disable `TRUST_PROXY`

`X-Forwarded-Proto` and `X-Forwarded-Host` are just regular HTTP
headers — anyone who can reach Lukaisu Server can send them. If your install is
exposed directly on the public internet **without** a proxy in front
that overwrites those headers, an attacker can spoof
`X-Forwarded-Proto: https` to coax Lukaisu Server into thinking unencrypted
requests are secure (weakening the cookie `Secure` flag among other
things).

Set `TRUST_PROXY=false` in that scenario:

```dotenv
TRUST_PROXY=false
```

Lukaisu Server then ignores the forwarded headers and falls back to the inner
connection's `HTTPS` / `SERVER_PORT` signals only. Setting `APP_URL`
alongside is still recommended for outbound URL generation.

## YouTube Import

Lukaisu Server can import captions from YouTube videos. To enable this feature:

1. Create a Google Cloud project at [Google Cloud Console](https://console.cloud.google.com/)
2. Enable the **YouTube Data API v3** for your project
3. Create an API key in the Credentials section
4. Add the key to your `.env` file:

   ```dotenv
   YT_API_KEY=your_api_key_here
   ```

5. Restart your web server

The YouTube import option will now appear when creating new texts.

## External Audio Sources (CSP Configuration)

By default, Lukaisu Server only allows audio files from the same server (for security). If you want to use audio from external sources (e.g., language learning websites), you can configure the Content Security Policy.

### Configuration

Add the `CSP_MEDIA_SOURCES` setting to your `.env` file:

```dotenv
# Option 1: Allow any HTTPS source (recommended for self-hosted instances)
CSP_MEDIA_SOURCES=https

# Option 2: Allow specific domains only
CSP_MEDIA_SOURCES=https://example.com,https://other-site.org

# Option 3: Strict mode - only local files (default)
CSP_MEDIA_SOURCES=self
```

### Security Considerations

| Setting | Security | Use Case |
|---------|----------|----------|
| `self` | Highest | Multi-user servers where privacy is critical |
| `https` | Moderate | Self-hosted instances with trusted users |
| Specific domains | High | When you know exactly which audio sources you'll use |

::: warning Privacy Note for Multi-User Servers
When `https` is enabled, users can add audio URLs pointing to external servers. When other users play that audio, the external server can log their IP addresses. For public multi-user servers where privacy matters, consider:

* Keeping the default `self` setting
* Implementing a media proxy (future feature)
* Whitelisting only trusted domains
