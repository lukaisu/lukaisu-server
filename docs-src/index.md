## What is Lukaisu Server?

**Lukaisu Server** is a tool for language learning inspired by [Stephen Krashen's](http://sdkrashen.com) principles of Second Language Acquisition, [LingQ](http://lingq.com), and ideas from [AJATT](http://www.alljapaneseallthetime.com) (All Japanese All The Time).

This is the **community-maintained fork** that improves upon the original with:
- Modern PHP 8.2+ support
- Smaller database size
- Better mobile experience
- Active development

## Quick Start

1. **Install a local web server** - Use [XAMPP](https://www.apachefriends.org/), [MAMP](http://mamp.info/en/index.html), or a LAMP stack
2. **Download Lukaisu Server** - Get the [latest release](https://github.com/lukaisu/lukaisu-server/releases)
3. **Configure database** - Copy `.env.example` to `.env` and set your credentials
4. **Start learning** - Create a language, import a text, and begin reading!

See the [Installation Guide](/guide/installation) for detailed instructions.
