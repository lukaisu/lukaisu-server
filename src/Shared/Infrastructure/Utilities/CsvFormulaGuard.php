 * Escapes cells before they land in a CSV/TSV export.

 * Excel, LibreOffice Calc, and Google Sheets treat any cell whose
 * first character is one of `=`, `+`, `-`, `@`, TAB (\t), or CR (\r)
 * as a formula expression — opening a hostile export evaluates that
 * formula in the user's spreadsheet (CVE-class issue often called
 * "CSV injection" or "formula injection"). User-supplied dictionary
 * entries or term translations starting with those characters would
 * trigger arbitrary formula execution.
 *
 * Mitigation: prepend a single quote (`'`) to any cell that starts
 * with one of those characters. The quote is consumed by Excel as a
 * "treat as text" marker and is invisible in the displayed cell; it
 * does show up in plain-text consumers but that is the lesser evil
 * versus formula execution.
